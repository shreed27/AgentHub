# ⚠️ DAIN.exe
### Autonomous On-Chain Intelligence // Agent Coordination Protocol

> **The chain doesn’t need more bots.  
It needs a nervous system.**

---

## ⌬ SIGNAL DETECTED

DAIN is a **cybernetic coordination layer** for autonomous AI agents operating on-chain.

No dashboards.
No buttons.
No babysitting bots.

You declare **intent**.  
The swarm figures out **execution**.

---

## ☠️ WHAT’S BROKEN

On-chain systems today are dumb but fast.

- Bots act alone  
- Intelligence is fragmented  
- Execution is rigid  
- Humans micromanage everything  

Result:  
⚠️ **Humans do machine work. Machines don’t think.**

Unacceptable.

---

## 🧠 DAIN FIX

DAIN introduces a missing primitive:

> **Autonomous coordination between specialized agents**

Not one brain.  
Not one god-agent.  
A **distributed mind**.

Agents observe.  
Agents negotiate.  
Agents execute.

The chain becomes reactive.

## 🤖 AGENTS (AUTONOMOUS UNITS)

Each agent is:
- Independent
- Replaceable
- Stateless or state-aware
- Incentive-compatible

### Deployed Units:
- **Execution Agent** → hits DEXs
- **Routing Agent** → finds paths
- **OSINT Agent** → off-chain intel
- **Risk Agent** → volatility & failure
- **Network Agent** → agent-to-agent comms

Add your own.
Fork reality.

## ⚡ HOW IT MOVES

Example intent:

> `swap SOL → USDC, minimize slippage`

What happens next is **not your concern**.

Internally:
- Market state evaluated
- Intelligence weighted
- Execution path optimized
- Transaction fired
- Result returned

No prompts.
No parameters.
No noise.
